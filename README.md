# Codice Alliance


Codice Alliance is an open source, modular integration framework building on DDF with the addition of DoD/IC and NATO support capabilities.

## Alliance Features
 * NITF/NSIF (STANAG 4545) Ingest and Parsing
    - Ingest and catalog NITF 2.1 imagery and build data-rich metacards for discovery and retrieval

    - Ingest FMV clips and extract KLV metadata for metacard creation

## Inherited DDF Features
 * Standardization
    - Building on established Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) and open standards avoids vendor lock-in

    - Capabilities can be extended by developing and sharing new features
    - Built on top of Apache Karaf for OSGi support
    - Apache Camel and Apache CXF integration
 * Flexibility
    - Only features required can be deployed
 * Federated Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) filter powered metadata catalog
     - Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) performs transformation between query standards
     - Apache Solr integration
        - Well Known Text (WKT) indexing and search for spatial awareness
        - Full text search
        - XPath searches
        - XML indexing
     - Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) KML, CSW, and WFS federated services
     - OpenSearch federated services
     - REST API for catalog operations
     - Integrated content framework to store actual products associated with the indexed metadata
     - Tika parser for extracting metadata from products
     - Plugin support for pre and post processing on all operations
     - Eventing for notifications
     - Metrics
 * Security
     - Web Service Security (WSS) functionality that comes with DDF is integrated throughout the system
         - SAML 2.0 Web Browser SSO Profile with included IdP server and client
         - SAML Security Token Service (STS) based on WS-Trust
         - Automatic protection and Single Sign On (SSO) for web applications without modifying the application itself
         - Extensible PDP with XACML 3.0 support for authorization decisions
         - LDAP integration
             - Included OSGi enabled OpenDJ LDAP server
         - CAS integration
         - X.509 authentication
         - Basic authentication
         - SAML authentication
         - Guest login support
         - Multiple realm login support to mix and match different authentication types and services between endpoints
         - WS-Security, WS-SecurityPolicy, WS-Policy, WS-Trust, WS-SecureConversation, WS-Addressing
     - Provides a pluggable and extensible Security Framework (a set of APIs that define the integration with the DDF framework)
     - Provides Security Service reference implementations for a realistic end-to-end use case.
     - Role and Attribute based access control
     - Attribute based filtering for searches performed throughout the system
     - Federated identity through metadata catalog
 * Search user interface
    - 3D WebGL map built off of Cesium
    - 2D map built off of OpenLayers 3
    - USNG/MGRS grid support
    - GeoNames geocoder integrated into both maps
    - CometD integration for push notifications
    - Upload and edit capability
    - Saved workspaces (searches and metadata artifacts)
 * Admin Web user interface
    - Web based install wizard
    - Application grid to organize configurations
    - Pluggable configuration pages for applications to simplify configurations for complex scenarios
    - Metrics web application to view up to date system metrics
 * Simplicity of installation and operation
    - Unzip and run
    - Configuration and Installation via a modern Admin Web console
 * Simplicity of Development
    - Build simple Java Objects and wire them in via a choice of dependency injection frameworks
    - Make use of widely available documentation and components for DDF's underlying technologies
    - Modular development supports multi-organizational and multi-regional teams
 
## Building
### What you need ###
* **Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or later** (LTS versions recommended)
  * **Minimum**: JDK 11 (LTS)
  * **Recommended**: JDK 17 (LTS)
  * **Supported**: JDK 21 (latest LTS)
  * Download: [Eclipse Temurin](https://adoptium.net/) (recommended) or [Oracle JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
* Make sure that your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is set to the newly installed JDK location, and that your `PATH` includes `%JAVA_HOME%\bin` (Windows) or `$JAVA_HOME/bin` (\*NIX).
* [Install Maven 3.1.0 \(or later\)](http://maven.apache.org/download.html). Maven 3.9.5+ is recommended. Make sure that your `PATH` includes the `MVN_HOME/bin` directory.
* Set the `MAVEN_OPTS` variable with the appropriate memory settings
### Optional 
* If you do not wish to run formatting from the commandline (see below) you may use an IDE to format the code for you with the google-java-format plugins.
  - https://github.com/google/google-java-format
    * IntelliJ: https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8527
    * Eclipse: https://github.com/google/google-java-format/releases/download/google-java-format-1.3/google-java-format-eclipse-plugin-1.3.0.jar



### How to build ###
In order to run through a full build, be sure to have a clone for the ddf repository and optionally the ddf-support repository (NOTE: daily snapshots are deployed so downloading and building each repo may not be necessary since those artifacts will be retrieved.):

```
git clone git://github.com/codice/alliance.git
```
Change to the root directory of the cloned ddf repository. Run the following command:

```
mvn install
```


#### Formatting
If during development the build fails for formatting, eg:
```
Failed to execute goal com.coveo:fmt-maven-plugin:1.8.0:check (default-cli) on project <module name>: Found <number> non-complying files, failing build
 ```
You can run the formatter with the command:
```
mvn fmt:format
```

This will compile Alliance and run all of the tesets in the Alliance source distribution. It usually takes some time for maven to download required dependencies in the first build.
The distribution will be available under "distribution/alliance/target" directory.

### How to build using multiple threads ###

To build Alliance using the [parallel builds feature of maven](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MAVEN/Parallel+builds+in+Maven+3), Run the following command:

```
mvn install -T 8
```

Which tells maven to use 8 threads when building Alliance. You can manually adjust the thread count to suit your machine, or use a relative thread count to the number of cores present on your machine by running the following command:

```
mvn install -T 1.5C
```

Which will use 6 threads if your machine has 4 cores.

## How to Run
* Unzip the distribution. 
* Run the executable at <distribution_home>/bin/alliance.bat or <distribution_home>/bin/alliance

Many thanks for using Alliance.
