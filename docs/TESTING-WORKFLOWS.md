# Testing GitHub Actions Workflows

## Current Status

‚úÖ **Workflows Created and Committed**

Branch: `feature/github-actions-phase1`
Commit: `01ec9ac4` - "ci: add GitHub Actions workflows for DO-278 compliance (Phase 1)"

All workflow YAML syntax has been validated and fixed:
- ‚úÖ build.yml - Main CI/CD pipeline
- ‚úÖ security-scan.yml - Security scanning
- ‚úÖ test-coverage.yml - Coverage tracking

## Testing Steps

### Step 1: Push the Branch to GitHub

```bash
# Push the feature branch to GitHub
git push origin feature/github-actions-phase1
```

This will trigger the **build.yml** workflow automatically (configured for all branches).

### Step 2: Create a Pull Request

```bash
# Via GitHub UI or gh CLI:
gh pr create \
  --title "ci: Add GitHub Actions workflows (Phase 1)" \
  --body "$(cat docs/PHASE1-COMPLETE.md)" \
  --base master \
  --head feature/github-actions-phase1
```

Creating a PR will trigger ALL workflows:
- ‚úÖ build.yml ‚Üí validate, incremental-build jobs
- ‚úÖ security-scan.yml ‚Üí all security scanning jobs
- ‚úÖ test-coverage.yml ‚Üí coverage-report job

### Step 3: Monitor Workflow Execution

1. Go to **Actions** tab on GitHub
2. You should see three workflow runs:
   - "Build and Test"
   - "Security Scanning"
   - "Test Coverage Analysis"

3. Click on each to view detailed logs

### Step 4: Review Workflow Results

#### Expected Outcomes:

**Build and Test Workflow:**
- ‚úÖ validate job - Quick POM and formatting check
- ‚ö†Ô∏è incremental-build job - May succeed or fail depending on changes
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è full-build job - Skipped (only runs on non-PR events)
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è deploy job - Skipped (only runs on master/version branches)

**Security Scanning Workflow:**
- ‚úÖ dependency-check - OWASP scan (may find vulnerabilities)
- ‚úÖ codeql-analysis - Semantic security analysis
- ‚úÖ dependency-review - Check for vulnerable dependencies in PR
- ‚úÖ secret-scan - TruffleHog scan for secrets
- ‚ö†Ô∏è license-check - May succeed or fail, not critical
- ‚úÖ security-summary - Aggregates all results

**Test Coverage Analysis Workflow:**
- ‚úÖ coverage-report - Generate and analyze coverage
- ‚úÖ integration-coverage - Integration test coverage
- üìä PR comment - Coverage summary will be posted automatically

#### What Could Fail (and why it's okay):

1. **OWASP Dependency Check** - Will likely find vulnerabilities
   - This is EXPECTED and GOOD
   - Shows the security scanning is working
   - Auto-creates GitHub issue for tracking
   - Follow Security Remediation Process in CLAUDE.md

2. **CodeQL Analysis** - May find security/quality issues
   - First-time analysis baseline
   - Review findings, create issues for real problems
   - Some may be false positives

3. **Coverage Below Baseline** - Possible if current coverage is unknown
   - Check the artifacts for actual coverage %
   - May need to adjust baseline in test-coverage.yml

4. **Integration Tests** - May fail due to environment differences
   - GitHub Actions uses Ubuntu containers
   - May need adjustments for CI environment

### Step 5: Review Artifacts

Each workflow uploads artifacts:

1. **Build and Test Artifacts:**
   - `test-results-incremental` - JUnit test reports
   - `jacoco-reports` - Coverage reports (HTML)

2. **Security Scanning Artifacts:**
   - `owasp-dependency-check-report` - Vulnerability report (HTML)
   - `license-compliance-report` - License check results

3. **Test Coverage Artifacts:**
   - `jacoco-coverage-reports` - Detailed coverage (HTML)
   - `module-coverage-summary` - Per-module analysis (Markdown)

Download and review these to understand current project status.

### Step 6: Check PR Comments

The workflows will post comments to your PR:

1. **Security Scan Summary** - Table of security check results
2. **Coverage Report** - Overall and per-module coverage percentages

These provide quick visibility without digging into logs.

## Troubleshooting

### If Workflows Don't Trigger

**Check:**
1. Workflows are only enabled on repositories with Actions enabled
2. Go to Settings ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí General
3. Ensure "Allow all actions and reusable workflows" is selected

### If Workflows Fail

**Common Issues:**

1. **Maven dependency download timeout**
   ```
   Solution: Re-run the workflow (GitHub Actions caches dependencies after first run)
   ```

2. **OWASP NVD database download fails**
   ```
   Solution: This is cached. First run may be slow. Re-run if timeout occurs.
   ```

3. **Checkstyle/formatting errors**
   ```
   Solution: Run locally first:
   mvn fmt:format
   mvn checkstyle:check
   ```

4. **Coverage file not found**
   ```
   Solution: Workflow has fallback logic. Check logs to see which file it used.
   If none found, jacoco plugin may not be configured correctly.
   ```

5. **Test failures**
   ```
   Solution: Tests should pass locally first. Check test-results artifacts.
   May be environment-specific issues (timezone, locale, etc.)
   ```

### If You Need to Modify Workflows

1. Make changes in your local branch
2. Commit and push
3. Workflows re-run automatically on new push
4. Iterate until green

## Expected Timeline

- **First run**: 15-30 minutes (cold cache, downloading dependencies)
- **Subsequent runs**: 5-10 minutes (warm cache)
- **Incremental builds**: 3-5 minutes

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ **Minimum Success:**
- Build workflow completes (tests may fail, that's data)
- Security workflow completes (vulnerabilities expected)
- Coverage workflow generates reports
- Artifacts uploaded successfully

üéØ **Ideal Success:**
- All tests pass
- Coverage meets baseline (75%)
- Security scan identifies known issues (proves it works)
- PR comments posted successfully

## Next Steps After Validation

Once workflows are validated:

1. **Merge the PR** (after review)
2. **Configure GitHub Secrets** (for deployment)
   - MAVEN_USERNAME
   - MAVEN_PASSWORD

3. **Enable Branch Protection**
   - Require workflow passes
   - Require PR reviews

4. **Enable Dependabot** (already configured, just needs activation)

5. **Parallel Operation**
   - Run both Jenkins and GitHub Actions for 1-2 weeks
   - Compare results
   - Build confidence

6. **Transition to Primary**
   - Update README with badges
   - Make GitHub Actions required
   - Keep Jenkins as backup

7. **Start Phase 2**
   - Enhanced testing infrastructure
   - Security test harnesses
   - Coverage improvements
