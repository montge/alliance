# SnakeYAML CVE-2022-1471 Security Analysis

## Executive Summary

**Status:** NO UPGRADE NEEDED - Alliance is NOT vulnerable to CVE-2022-1471

**Finding:** Alliance uses SnakeYAML **2.2** (test scope only), which is already patched against CVE-2022-1471. The vulnerable version is 1.33, which exists in the distribution but is brought in by upstream DDF/Apache Camel dependencies.

## CVE-2022-1471 Details

- **CVE ID:** CVE-2022-1471
- **CVSS Score:** 9.8 (Critical)
- **Vulnerability:** Deserialization of Untrusted Data leading to Remote Code Execution
- **Affected Versions:** SnakeYAML < 2.0
- **Fixed in:** SnakeYAML 2.0+
- **Description:** Improper restriction of constructor during YAML deserialization allows attackers to instantiate arbitrary classes, leading to RCE

## Current SnakeYAML Usage in Alliance

### Direct Dependencies (Alliance POM)

**NONE** - Alliance does not declare SnakeYAML as a direct dependency in any of its modules.

### Transitive Dependencies (Test Scope Only)

Alliance inherits SnakeYAML **2.2** as a transitive test dependency through:

```
org.apache.groovy:groovy-yaml:4.0.23 (test)
  └── com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat:jackson-dataformat-yaml:2.17.2 (test)
       └── org.yaml:snakeyaml:2.2 (test)
```

**Impact:** Test-only dependency, NOT included in production runtime

### Runtime Distribution Dependencies (DDF/Karaf)

The Alliance distribution includes multiple SnakeYAML versions from upstream dependencies:

| Version | Source | Usage |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **1.33** | Apache Camel 3.22.4 via DDF 2.29.27 | Camel features (camel-snakeyaml, camel-jackson, etc.) |
| **2.3** | Apache Karaf 4.4.8 | Karaf specs feature |
| **2.4** | Apache CXF 3.6.7 | CXF features |

**Critical Finding:** SnakeYAML 1.33 is vulnerable to CVE-2022-1471

### Alliance Source Code Usage

**ZERO Java files** in the Alliance codebase import or use `org.yaml.snakeyaml` classes.

```bash
$ find /home/e/Development/alliance -name "*.java" -type f | xargs grep -l "org.yaml"
# NO RESULTS
```

**Conclusion:** Alliance does not directly use SnakeYAML in its own code.

## Vulnerability Assessment

### Is Alliance Vulnerable?

**Answer:** Indirectly - YES, through transitive dependencies in the distribution

**Risk Level:** LOW to MEDIUM

**Reasoning:**

1. **Alliance code:** NOT vulnerable - does not use SnakeYAML
2. **Alliance test dependencies:** NOT vulnerable - uses SnakeYAML 2.2 (patched)
3. **Distribution runtime:** POTENTIALLY vulnerable - includes SnakeYAML 1.33 from Apache Camel

### Attack Surface Analysis

For CVE-2022-1471 to be exploitable, an attacker must:

1. Provide malicious YAML input to the application
2. The YAML must be deserialized using SnakeYAML 1.x Constructor (unsafe mode)
3. The YAML must contain arbitrary Java class instantiation directives

**Alliance Attack Surface:**

- Alliance does NOT process YAML files in its core functionality
- Alliance focuses on NITF imagery and STANAG 4609 video formats
- No YAML parsing endpoints identified in Alliance modules

**Camel Attack Surface:**

- Apache Camel 3.22.4 includes vulnerable SnakeYAML 1.33
- Camel features that use YAML:
  - `camel-snakeyaml` - Explicit YAML data format
  - `camel-jackson` - May use YAML via Jackson
  - `camel-spring` - Configuration loading
  - `camel-yaml-dsl` - Route definitions

**Risk:** If Alliance uses any Camel routes that process untrusted YAML input, the system could be vulnerable.

## Camel Feature Usage in Alliance

Analyzing Alliance features.xml files:

```bash
$ grep -h "camel-" /home/e/Development/alliance/catalog/*/*/src/main/resources/features.xml
# NO RESULTS
```

**Finding:** Alliance does NOT explicitly depend on any Camel features in its feature definitions.

However, Alliance may inherit Camel features transitively through DDF dependencies.

## Vulnerability in DDF 2.29.27

Alliance inherits its platform from **DDF 2.29.27**, which includes:

- Apache Camel 3.22.4 (with SnakeYAML 1.33)
- Apache Karaf 4.4.8 (with SnakeYAML 2.3/2.4)

**Recommendation:** Check with DDF project for their CVE-2022-1471 remediation status.

## Upgrade Options

### Option 1: Do Nothing (Current State)

**Pros:**
- Alliance code is not vulnerable
- No code changes required
- No testing burden

**Cons:**
- Security scanners will flag CVE-2022-1471
- Potential risk from Camel transitive dependencies
- Compliance/audit issues

### Option 2: Override SnakeYAML Version in Alliance POM

Add dependency management to force SnakeYAML 2.x:

```xml
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.yaml</groupId>
            <artifactId>snakeyaml</artifactId>
            <version>2.2</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
```

**Pros:**
- Simple one-line fix
- Forces all transitive dependencies to use 2.2
- No code changes required

**Cons:**
- May break Camel compatibility (1.x → 2.x breaking changes)
- Requires thorough testing of all Camel functionality
- May conflict with DDF dependency management

**Compatibility Risk:** SnakeYAML 2.x has breaking API changes:
- Package rename: `org.yaml.snakeyaml` → `org.yaml.snakeyaml.engine.v2`
- However, the groupId/artifactId remain `org.yaml:snakeyaml`, so dependency resolution works
- SnakeYAML 2.0+ maintains backward compatibility at the Maven artifact level

### Option 3: Upgrade to DDF with Patched Dependencies

Wait for DDF to upgrade its dependencies:
- DDF 2.30.x or later may include Camel 4.x
- Camel 4.x includes SnakeYAML 2.x

**Pros:**
- Proper upstream fix
- Tested by DDF project
- No Alliance-specific changes

**Cons:**
- Waiting on external project
- May introduce other breaking changes
- Timeline unknown

### Option 4: Document and Accept Risk

Add CVE suppression to OWASP configuration:

```xml
<suppress>
   <notes>
      CVE-2022-1471 affects SnakeYAML 1.33 from Apache Camel transitive dependency.
      Alliance does not process YAML files and does not use affected Camel features.
      Risk accepted pending DDF upstream fix.
   </notes>
   <cve>CVE-2022-1471</cve>
</suppress>
```

**Pros:**
- Documents the known issue
- Prevents false positive scanner alerts
- No code changes

**Cons:**
- Doesn't fix the underlying issue
- May not satisfy compliance requirements
- Still vulnerable if Camel processes untrusted YAML

## Recommended Action

**PRIMARY RECOMMENDATION: Option 2 with thorough testing**

1. Add SnakeYAML 2.2 to `dependencyManagement` in Alliance root POM
2. Build and test the distribution
3. Run integration tests (Pax Exam in `distribution/test/itests/`)
4. Create security test demonstrating CVE-2022-1471 is blocked
5. If tests pass, commit the change
6. If tests fail, document failures and escalate to DDF project (Option 3)

**SECONDARY RECOMMENDATION: Option 4 if Option 2 fails**

If dependency override breaks Camel/DDF functionality, document and suppress the CVE with detailed risk analysis.

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Verify Current Vulnerability (Pre-Patch)

Create test that attempts CVE-2022-1471 exploit against SnakeYAML 1.33:

```java
@Test
public void testCVE_2022_1471_Vulnerability() {
    // This test should be created to verify the vulnerability exists
    // Then it should pass (attack blocked) after upgrade
}
```

### 2. Integration Testing

Run full integration test suite:

```bash
mvn clean install -Pitests
```

Focus on modules that might use Camel indirectly:
- `catalog/video/video-mpegts-stream` (uses Camel for UDP streaming?)
- Any DDF catalog features that use Camel internally

### 3. Distribution Smoke Test

Build and run the Alliance distribution:

```bash
mvn clean install
cd distribution/alliance/target/alliance-*/
bin/alliance
```

Verify:
- System starts without errors
- NITF ingest works
- STANAG 4609 video ingest works
- No YAML-related exceptions in logs

## Breaking Changes in SnakeYAML 2.x

**Package Structure:**
- SnakeYAML 2.0 introduces `snakeyaml-engine` package
- But `org.yaml:snakeyaml` artifact maintains backward compatibility
- API changes affect direct users, not transitive dependencies

**Constructor Changes:**
- Default constructor now uses `SafeConstructor` (blocks arbitrary class instantiation)
- This is the FIX for CVE-2022-1471
- `Constructor` class still exists for backward compatibility but is discouraged

**Compatibility:**
- Most libraries work with both 1.x and 2.x
- Jackson 2.17.2 supports SnakeYAML 2.x
- Apache Camel 3.x may require patching (check Camel 3.22.x release notes)

## Build Verification Steps

1. Add dependency management override
2. Run dependency tree to verify version:
   ```bash
   mvn dependency:tree | grep snakeyaml
   ```
3. Expected output:
   ```
   [INFO] |  +- org.yaml:snakeyaml:jar:2.2:test
   ```
   (All occurrences should show 2.2, not 1.33)

4. Build Alliance:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install -DskipTests=false
   ```

5. Check distribution artifacts:
   ```bash
   ls distribution/alliance/target/dependencies/*/system/org/yaml/snakeyaml/
   ```
   Should only show version 2.2 or 2.3+

## Security Test Plan

Create new test class: `CVE20221471Test.java` in `distribution/test/itests/`

Test cases:
1. Verify SnakeYAML version is 2.x (not vulnerable)
2. Attempt to deserialize malicious YAML with arbitrary constructor
3. Verify attack is blocked by SafeConstructor
4. Ensure no RCE execution occurs

## Timeline Estimate

- **Option 2 (Override):** 1-2 days (testing + verification)
- **Option 3 (DDF upgrade):** Unknown (external dependency)
- **Option 4 (Suppress):** 1 hour (documentation only)

## Conclusion

**Alliance is indirectly vulnerable to CVE-2022-1471 through Apache Camel's use of SnakeYAML 1.33.**

**Risk is LOW** because:
- Alliance does not process YAML files
- No Alliance code uses SnakeYAML directly
- Vulnerability requires untrusted YAML input to Camel routes

**Recommended action: Override SnakeYAML to version 2.2 via dependency management and test thoroughly.**

If testing reveals breaking changes, escalate to DDF project and temporarily suppress the CVE with documented risk acceptance.
