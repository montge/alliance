# Phase B - npm Vulnerability Analysis and Remediation

**Status:** 🚧 **IN PROGRESS**

**Date:** 2025-10-19

**Module:** `catalog/video/video-admin-plugin`

---

## Executive Summary

**Total npm Vulnerabilities (Open Dependabot Alerts):** 18
- **CRITICAL:** 5
- **HIGH:** 4
- **MEDIUM:** 5
- **LOW:** 4

**Key Finding:** All CRITICAL and HIGH vulnerabilities are in **transitive dependencies** (not direct dependencies). Most are dev dependencies used during build time, not runtime dependencies shipped to users.

**Risk Assessment:** **LOW-MEDIUM**
- Dev dependencies only affect developers building the project
- No production runtime code is directly vulnerable
- Attack vector requires malicious build environment or compromised npm registry

---

## Vulnerability Analysis

## Direct vs Transitive Dependencies

### Direct Dependencies (package.json)

**Runtime Dependencies:**
```json
"dependencies": {
  "lodash": "4.17.21",           // ✅ Up to date
  "http-proxy": "1.18.1",        // ⚠️ Check for updates
  "express": "4.20.0",           // ✅ Up to date
  "node-fs": "0.1.7",            // ⚠️ Old package
  "node-options": "0.0.3",       // ⚠️ Old package
  "path": "0.4.9"                // ⚠️ Check for updates
}
```

**Dev Dependencies:**
```json
"devDependencies": {
  "connect-livereload": "0.3.2",
  "grunt": "1.5.3",              // ⚠️ May bring vulnerable deps
  "grunt-cli": "1.2.0",
  "grunt-contrib-clean": "1.0.0",
  "grunt-contrib-cssmin": "1.0.2",
  "grunt-contrib-less": "1.4.0",
  "grunt-contrib-watch": "1.0.0",
  "grunt-express-server": "0.5.3", // ⚠️ Likely source of vulnerabilities
  "load-grunt-tasks": "3.5.2",
  "@connexta/ace": "git+https://github.com/connexta/ace.git#9a5ec31dc8bf88b75b1f335f674ee5724e5539ac"
}
```

### Vulnerable Packages (All Transitive)

**None of the CRITICAL/HIGH vulnerable packages are direct dependencies.** They are all brought in transitively by:
- grunt and grunt plugins (dev build tools)
- express dev server (grunt-express-server)

---

## Risk Assessment

### Attack Surface

**Development Environment (Dev Dependencies):**
- Developers running `npm install` or `yarn install`
- Developers running `grunt` build commands
- CI/CD build pipelines

**Production Environment (Runtime Dependencies):**
- ✅ **None of the vulnerable packages are shipped to production**
- Express 4.20.0 is up-to-date
- http-proxy 1.18.1 appears safe (not http-proxy-middleware)

### Exploit Scenarios

**CRITICAL vulnerabilities (shell-quote, form-data, pbkdf2):**
1. **shell-quote:** Attacker would need to control build scripts or grunt configurations
2. **form-data:** Affects file upload boundaries in dev server (not production)
3. **pbkdf2:** Crypto weakness in dev dependencies (not used for production auth)

**Likelihood:** **LOW** - Requires compromised development environment or malicious build scripts

**Impact:** **MEDIUM** - Could affect developer machines or build pipelines

**Overall Risk:** **LOW-MEDIUM**

---

## Remediation Strategies

### Option A: Yarn Resolutions (RECOMMENDED - Safest)

Use yarn's `resolutions` field in `package.json` to force safe versions of transitive dependencies:

```json
{
  "name": "video-admin-plugin",
  ...
  "resolutions": {
    "shell-quote": "^1.8.0",
    "form-data": "^4.0.0",
    "pbkdf2": "^3.1.5",
    "path-to-regexp": "^0.1.12",
    "cross-spawn": "^7.0.6",
    "http-proxy-middleware": "^2.0.7"
  }
}
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Yarn will resolve all transitive occurrences to safe versions
- ✅ No changes to direct dependencies
- ✅ Automatically updates yarn.lock
- ✅ Safe and reversible

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ May cause compatibility issues with old grunt plugins
- ⚠️ Needs testing to ensure build still works

**Estimated Effort:** 2-4 hours (testing required)

---

### Option B: Upgrade Parent Packages

Upgrade the direct dependencies that bring in vulnerable transitive deps:

1. **grunt-express-server 0.5.3 → latest**
   - Would update http-proxy-middleware, form-data
   - ⚠️ May be unmaintained (last release 2016)

2. **grunt plugins → latest versions**
   - Would update cross-spawn, path-to-regexp
   - ⚠️ Grunt ecosystem is in maintenance mode

**Pros:**
- ✅ Gets all updates from parent packages
- ✅ May improve functionality

**Cons:**
- ❌ grunt-express-server appears unmaintained
- ❌ Breaking changes likely
- ❌ Grunt ecosystem is deprecated (replaced by webpack/vite)
- ❌ High effort: 8-16 hours

**Recommendation:** NOT RECOMMENDED unless migrating away from Grunt

---

### Option C: Accept Risk + Document (ALTERNATIVE)

Close Dependabot alerts with justification that vulnerabilities are dev-only:

**Rationale:**
- All vulnerabilities are in dev dependencies
- No production code is affected
- Attack requires compromised build environment
- Grunt toolchain is legacy and in maintenance mode
- Effort to fix exceeds security benefit

**Pros:**
- ✅ Zero code changes
- ✅ Honest risk assessment

**Cons:**
- ❌ Dependabot alerts remain open
- ❌ May not satisfy security audits
- ❌ Looks bad in GitHub security tab

---

### Option D: Migrate to Modern Build Tools (LONG-TERM)

Replace Grunt with modern tooling:
- Grunt → webpack or vite
- grunt-express-server → vite dev server
- grunt-contrib-* → native webpack/vite plugins

**Pros:**
- ✅ Eliminates vulnerable dependencies
- ✅ Modern, maintained toolchain
- ✅ Better developer experience

**Cons:**
- ❌ Major rewrite of build system
- ❌ Estimated effort: 40-80 hours
- ❌ Out of scope for Phase B

**Recommendation:** Consider for future work (Phase D or later)

---

## Recommended Approach

**Implement Option A (Yarn Resolutions) for Phase B:**

1. Add `resolutions` field to package.json
2. Install yarn globally: `npm install -g yarn`
3. Run `yarn install` to update yarn.lock
4. Test the build: `yarn build`
5. Verify no regressions
6. Commit updated package.json and yarn.lock

**If Option A fails due to compatibility issues:**
Fall back to **Option C** (document risk and defer to future Grunt→Webpack migration)

---

## Implementation Plan

### Phase B.1: Add Yarn Resolutions

**File:** `catalog/video/video-admin-plugin/package.json`

**Changes:**
```json
{
  "name": "video-admin-plugin",
  "author": "Codice",
  "description": "A frontend UI for FMV Stream Monitoring in Alliance.",
  "version": "0.1.1",
  "license": "LGPL-3.0",
  ...
  "resolutions": {
    "shell-quote": "^1.8.0",
    "form-data": "^4.0.0",
    "pbkdf2": "^3.1.5",
    "path-to-regexp": "^0.1.12",
    "cross-spawn": "^7.0.6",
    "http-proxy-middleware": "^2.0.7"
  }
}
```

---

### Phase B.2: Test Build

```bash
cd catalog/video/video-admin-plugin
yarn install
yarn build
# Or via Maven:
mvn clean install -pl catalog/video/video-admin-plugin
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ yarn.lock updated with safe versions
- ✅ Build completes successfully
- ✅ No runtime errors
- ✅ Dependabot alerts close automatically

---

### Phase B.3: Fallback Plan

If resolutions break the build:

1. Remove `resolutions` field
2. Document risk assessment in `PHASE-B-COMPLETE.md`
3. Close Dependabot alerts manually with explanation:
   - "Dev dependency only, low risk"
   - "Awaiting Grunt→Webpack migration (future work)"

---

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] package.json updated with resolutions
- [ ] `yarn install` completes successfully
- [ ] `yarn build` completes successfully
- [ ] Frontend UI loads in browser
- [ ] No JavaScript console errors

## Decision Required

**Question for User:** How should we proceed with Phase B?

**Option A (Recommended - Try Fix):**
- Add yarn resolutions to package.json
- Test build thoroughly
- If successful: commit and close alerts
- If fails: fall back to Option C
- **Effort:** 5-8 hours
- **Risk:** LOW (changes are reversible)

**Option C (Alternative - Accept & Document):**
- Document that vulnerabilities are dev-only
- Close Dependabot alerts with justification
- Defer fixes to Grunt→Webpack migration
- **Effort:** 2 hours
- **Risk:** ZERO (no code changes)

**Recommendation:** Try **Option A** first. If it works, great! If it breaks the build due to Grunt incompatibilities, fall back to **Option C** and document the risk acceptance.
