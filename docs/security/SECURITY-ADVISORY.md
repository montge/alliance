## Known Remaining Vulnerabilities

### Critical Finding: False Positives (No Action Required)

**mxparser/XStream Confusion - 40+ False Positive CVEs**

The OWASP dependency scanner incorrectly attributes XStream CVEs to the mxparser library. These are NOT actual vulnerabilities in Alliance:

- **Affected Scanner Results:** CVE-2021-21345, CVE-2013-7285, CVE-2021-21344/46/47/50/42/51, and 30+ others
- **Actual Library:** mxparser-1.2.2 (lightweight XML parser, fork of xpp3_min)
- **Confused With:** XStream (completely different library for XML serialization)
- **Alliance's Real XStream Version:** 1.4.21 (via DDF) - all these CVEs are already patched
- **Risk:** NONE - False positive
- **Action Required:** NONE

## Required Actions for Users

### Immediate Actions (ALL USERS)

**1. Upgrade to Latest Alliance Release**

Ensure you are running Alliance 1.17.5 or later, which includes all Phase A and Phase B security fixes.

```bash
# Check your current Alliance version
cat alliance-<version>/version.txt

# If version < 1.17.5, download the latest release
unzip alliance-1.17.5.zip
cd alliance-1.17.5
./bin/alliance
```

**2. Review DDF Version**

Alliance is built on DDF 2.29.27. Many remaining vulnerabilities require DDF upgrades.

**Current DDF Version:** 2.29.27
**Recommended Action:** Monitor DDF releases for version 2.29.28+ which may address upstream CVEs

**Where to Check:**
- DDF Release Notes: https://github.com/codice/ddf/releases
- Alliance Dependencies: Check `pom.xml` for `<ddf.version>` property

**3. Network Security Controls**

Implement defense-in-depth network controls to mitigate upstream vulnerabilities:

- **Firewall Rules:** Restrict access to Alliance ports to trusted networks only
- **Network Segmentation:** Isolate Alliance in a protected network segment
- **Access Control Lists:** Limit which systems can connect to Alliance services
- **TLS/SSL:** Ensure all external communications use encrypted channels

### High-Priority Actions (PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENTS)

**4. Disable Unused Services**

Reduce attack surface by disabling components with known upstream vulnerabilities if not needed:

```bash
# Example: Disable Solr if not using catalog search features
# Edit etc/org.apache.karaf.features.cfg
# Remove solr-related features from featuresBoot

# Example: Disable Keycloak if using different authentication
# Remove keycloak features from featuresBoot
```

**5. Input Validation and Sanitization**

Many vulnerabilities require untrusted input. Implement strict input validation:

- **Deserialization:** Never deserialize objects from untrusted sources
- **XML Processing:** Use secure XML parsers with XXE protection enabled
- **Template Processing:** Do not compile Handlebars templates from user input
- **JMS/Configuration:** Restrict JMS and Quartz configuration to trusted administrators only

**6. Monitoring and Intrusion Detection**

Deploy monitoring to detect exploitation attempts:

- **Log Analysis:** Monitor for unusual deserialization, XML parsing, or authentication patterns
- **Anomaly Detection:** Alert on unexpected network connections or process execution
- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** Integrate Alliance logs with SIEM platform

### Recommended Actions (ALL ENVIRONMENTS)

**7. Plan DDF Upgrade**

Work with your Alliance vendor/support team to plan a DDF upgrade when DDF 2.29.28+ is released:

- Test DDF upgrades in non-production environment first
- Review DDF release notes for breaking changes
- Coordinate upgrade during maintenance window
- Verify all Alliance functionality after upgrade

**8. Subscribe to Security Notifications**

Stay informed about Alliance security updates:

- Watch the Alliance GitHub repository: https://github.com/codice/alliance

- **Penetration Testing:** Conduct penetration tests (with proper authorization)
- **Configuration Review:** Audit Alliance configuration for security best practices
- **Access Control Audit:** Review user permissions and authentication settings

---

## Mitigation Strategies for Unfixable Issues

### Defense-in-Depth Approach

Since ~240 vulnerabilities are in upstream DDF dependencies, implement multiple layers of defense:

**Layer 1: Network Isolation**
- Deploy Alliance behind a Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- Use VPN or private networks for administrative access
- Implement IP allowlisting for known client systems
- Enable mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication for service-to-service communication

**Layer 2: Application Hardening**
- Run Alliance with least-privilege service accounts
- Use SELinux or AppArmor to restrict process capabilities
- Disable unnecessary Karaf features and bundles
- Configure secure defaults for all services

**Layer 3: Runtime Protection**
- Deploy runtime application self-protection (RASP) tools
- Use Java security manager policies to restrict permissions
- Enable Java deserialization filtering (JEP 290)
- Configure Content Security Policy (CSP) headers for UI components

**Layer 4: Monitoring and Response**
- Implement real-time security monitoring
- Configure automated alerting for suspicious activity
- Maintain incident response procedures
- Conduct regular security drills

### Specific Mitigations by Vulnerability Type

**Deserialization Vulnerabilities (MINA, Commons-Collections, Quartz)**

```java
// Enable Java deserialization filtering (Java 9+)
// Add to JVM startup parameters:
-Djdk.serialFilter=!org.apache.commons.collections.**;!org.quartz.**;maxdepth=5;maxarray=1000

// Or use ObjectInputFilter programmatically
ObjectInputFilter filter = ObjectInputFilter.Config.createFilter(
    "!org.apache.commons.collections.**;!org.quartz.**"
);
ObjectInputFilter.Config.setSerialFilter(filter);
```

**XXE Vulnerabilities (Calcite, JDOM)**

```java
// Secure XML parser configuration (already implemented in Alliance)
DocumentBuilderFactory dbf = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
dbf.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl", true);
dbf.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities", false);
dbf.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities", false);
dbf.setXIncludeAware(false);
dbf.setExpandEntityReferences(false);
```

**RCE via Configuration (CXF, Quartz, Kafka)**

- Restrict administrative access using role-based access control (RBAC)
- Validate all configuration inputs against allowlists
- Use read-only configuration files with restricted file permissions
- Audit configuration changes with version control

**UI Vulnerabilities (Handlebars, Angular.js)**

```javascript
// Content Security Policy headers
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; object-src 'none'

// Do not compile templates from user input
// Use pre-compiled templates only
```

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### General Questions

**Q: Is Alliance safe to use in production?**

A: Yes, with proper security controls. Alliance has addressed 94% of vulnerabilities it can directly control. The remaining issues are primarily in upstream DDF dependencies and can be mitigated using defense-in-depth strategies outlined in this advisory. Follow the "Required Actions for Users" section to ensure a secure deployment.

**Q: What is the overall security risk level?**

A: MEDIUM. While there are critical vulnerabilities in upstream dependencies, most require specific attack conditions (untrusted input, configuration access, etc.) that can be controlled through proper deployment practices.

**Q: Should I wait for all vulnerabilities to be fixed before deploying Alliance?**

A: No. The remaining vulnerabilities are being addressed through DDF upgrades and future Alliance releases. Deploy with the recommended mitigations, and plan for upgrades as they become available.

**Q: How often are security updates released?**

A: Alliance follows a continuous improvement approach. Security fixes are included in regular releases. Critical security issues may warrant emergency patch releases. Subscribe to Alliance notifications to stay informed.

### Vulnerability-Specific Questions

**Q: Are the 40+ XStream CVEs affecting my Alliance deployment?**

A: No. These are false positives caused by OWASP scanner misidentifying mxparser as XStream. Alliance uses XStream 1.4.21 (via DDF), which has all these CVEs patched. No action is required.

**Q: Can I fix the DDF upstream vulnerabilities myself?**

A: Generally not recommended. Attempting to override DDF dependencies in Alliance can cause compatibility issues and break DDF functionality. The safer approach is to:
1. Implement mitigation strategies from this advisory
2. Wait for DDF to release updates
3. Upgrade Alliance when it incorporates newer DDF versions

**Q: When will Commons-Collections be upgraded?**

A: Planned for Phase 3D (future release). This is a major breaking change requiring 40-80 hours of development effort and coordination with the DDF team. Interim mitigations are available (see "Deferred Alliance-Controllable Issues" section).

**Q: What about the npm vulnerabilities?**

A: 8 out of 9 CRITICAL/HIGH npm vulnerabilities were fixed in Phase B (89% remediation rate). The one remaining vulnerability (http-proxy-middleware) is a dev dependency only and poses no production risk.

### Deployment and Operations Questions

**Q: Do I need to rebuild my Alliance installation?**

A: If running Alliance 1.17.5+, no rebuild is necessary - security fixes are already included. If running an older version, upgrade to the latest release.

**Q: Can I run Alliance in a cloud environment?**

A: Yes. Cloud deployments may benefit from additional security controls:
- Use cloud security groups/firewall rules for network isolation
- Deploy in private subnets with bastion hosts for access
- Use cloud-native monitoring and logging services
- Consider using cloud WAF services

**Q: What logs should I monitor for security events?**

A: Monitor these Alliance logs:
- `data/log/security.log` - Authentication and authorization events
- `data/log/alliance.log` - General application logs
- `data/log/karaf.log` - OSGi container logs
- Karaf audit logs (if enabled)

Look for patterns indicating:
- Failed authentication attempts
- Unexpected deserialization activity
- XML parsing errors
- Unusual network connections

**Q: How do I report a security vulnerability in Alliance?**

A: Please report security vulnerabilities responsibly:
1. Do NOT open public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities
2. Email security@codice.org with details
3. Use PGP encryption if possible
4. Allow reasonable time for a fix before public disclosure

### Technical Questions

**Q: What Java version is required?**

A: Alliance requires Java 8 (J2SE 8 SDK). Ensure you are running a recent Java 8 update with the latest security patches from your vendor (Oracle, OpenJDK, etc.).

**Q: Can I use Alliance with containerization (Docker, Kubernetes)?**

A: Yes. Alliance supports Docker deployments. Container security best practices apply:
- Use official Alliance container images
- Scan container images for vulnerabilities
- Use minimal base images
- Run containers as non-root users
- Implement container network policies

**Q: How do I enable Java deserialization filtering?**

A: For Java 9+, add JVM startup parameters to `bin/alliance`:

```bash
# Edit bin/alliance (Linux/Mac) or bin/alliance.bat (Windows)
# Add to JAVA_OPTS:
JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -Djdk.serialFilter=!org.apache.commons.collections.**;maxdepth=5"
```

For Java 8, deserialization filtering requires backported patches (8u121+) or third-party libraries like SerialKiller.
