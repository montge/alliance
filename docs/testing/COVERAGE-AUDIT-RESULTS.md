# Alliance Coverage Audit Results

**Generated:** October 18, 2025
**Build Command:** `mvn clean test jacoco:report -DskipITs=true`
**Analysis Date:** Saturday, October 18, 2025 14:57:30 EDT

## Executive Summary

This audit analyzed test coverage across the Alliance codebase to establish a baseline and identify gaps requiring attention. Coverage data was extracted from JaCoCo XML reports and analyzed using the `/home/e/Development/alliance/analyze-coverage.sh` script.

**Current Status:**
Build: IN PROGRESS (Module 52/59 at audit time)
Analysis: COMPLETE (19 JaCoCo reports processed)

## Overall Statistics

- **Total modules analyzed:** 21 modules with test coverage
- **🔴 Critical (< 70%):** 6 modules
- **⚠️ Below Baseline (70-75%):** 0 modules
- **✅ Good (75-89%):** 8 modules
- **✅ Excellent (≥ 90%):** 7 modules

**Coverage Distribution:**
- Critical: 29% (6/21)
- Below Baseline: 0% (0/21)
- Good: 38% (8/21)
- Excellent: 33% (7/21)

## Critical Coverage Gaps (< 70%)

These modules require immediate attention as they fall below the 75% baseline threshold:

| Module | Instruction % | Branch % | Complexity % | Path | Priority |
|--------|---------------|----------|--------------|------|----------|
| **banner-marking** | **0%** | **0%** | **0%** | `catalog/security/banner-marking` | **P0 CRITICAL** |
| **stanag4609** | **0%** | **50%** | **0%** | `libs/stanag4609` | **P0 CRITICAL** |
| **imaging-service-impl** | **0%** | **93%** | **0%** | `catalog/imaging/imaging-service-impl` | **P1 HIGH** |
| **klv** | 100% | **50%** | 100% | `libs/klv` | **P1 HIGH** |
| **imaging-transformer-chipping** | 100% | **50%** | 100% | `catalog/imaging/imaging-transformer-chipping` | P2 MEDIUM |
| **video-admin-plugin** | 100% | **50%** | 100% | `catalog/video/video-admin-plugin` | P2 MEDIUM |

### Critical Finding: Zero-Coverage Modules

Three modules have **0% instruction and complexity coverage**, indicating NO test code execution:

1. **banner-marking** (Security Module)
   - Current: 0% / 0% / 0%
   - Priority: **P0 CRITICAL**
   - Reason: Security banner validation for classified data
   - Risk: No validation of security markings on classified information
   - Impact: Potential mishandling of classified data

2. **stanag4609** (Video Metadata Library)
   - Current: 0% instruction, 50% branch, 0% complexity
   - Priority: **P0 CRITICAL**
   - Reason: STANAG 4609 KLV metadata extraction from FMV clips
   - Risk: Incorrect metadata parsing could lead to data loss or corruption
   - Impact: Mission-critical video metadata may be misprocessed

3. **imaging-service-impl** (Imaging Service)
   - Current: 0% instruction, 93% branch, 0% complexity
   - Priority: **P1 HIGH**
   - Note: High branch coverage (93%) suggests test infrastructure exists but instruction coverage is missing
   - Risk: Service logic untested
   - Impact: Image processing service failures

## Below Baseline Modules (70-75%)

**NONE** - No modules fall in the 70-75% range.

## Good Coverage Modules (75-89%)

These modules meet the baseline but could be improved:

| Module | Instruction % | Branch % | Complexity % | Path |
|--------|---------------|----------|--------------|------|
| catalog-plugin-auditcontrolledaccess | 100% | 87% | 100% | `catalog/plugin/catalog-plugin-auditcontrolledaccess` |
| catalog-plugin-defaultsecurityattributevalues | 100% | 83% | 100% | `catalog/plugin/catalog-plugin-defaultsecurityattributevalues` |
| imaging-nitf-impl | 100% | 83% | 100% | `catalog/imaging/imaging-nitf-impl` |
| video-mpegts-transformer | 100% | *N/A* | 100% | `catalog/video/video-mpegts-transformer` |
| catalog-core-api-impl | 100% | *N/A* | 100% | `catalog/core/catalog-core-api-impl` |
| catalog-email-impl | 100% | 75% | 100% | `catalog/core/catalog-email-impl` |

*Note: Some modules show missing branch % data in the report, but instruction and complexity are at 100%.*

## Excellent Coverage Modules (≥ 90%)

These modules demonstrate strong test coverage:

| Module | Instruction % | Branch % | Complexity % | Path |
|--------|---------------|----------|--------------|------|
| imaging-plugin-nitf | 100% | 100% | 100% | `catalog/imaging/imaging-plugin-nitf` |
| imaging-transformer-nitf | 100% | 100% | 100% | `catalog/imaging/imaging-transformer-nitf` |
| imaging-actionprovider-chip | 100% | 91% | 100% | `catalog/imaging/imaging-actionprovider-chip` |
| video-security | 100% | 90% | 100% | `catalog/video/video-security` |
| video-mpegts-stream | 100% | 100% | 100% | `catalog/video/video-mpegts-stream` |
| catalog-core-classification-impl | 100% | 100% | 100% | `catalog/core/catalog-core-classification-impl` |
| mpegts | 100% | 100% | 100% | `libs/mpegts` |

## Modules Not Requiring Immediate Attention

The following modules have good or excellent coverage and do not need immediate work:

**Excellent (7 modules):**
- imaging-plugin-nitf (100/100/100)
- imaging-transformer-nitf (100/100/100)
- imaging-actionprovider-chip (100/91/100)
- video-security (100/90/100)
- video-mpegts-stream (100/100/100)
- catalog-core-classification-impl (100/100/100)
- mpegts (100/100/100)

**Good (8 modules):**
- catalog-plugin-auditcontrolledaccess (100/87/100)
- catalog-plugin-defaultsecurityattributevalues (100/83/100)
- imaging-nitf-impl (100/83/100)
- video-mpegts-transformer (100/N/A/100)
- catalog-core-api-impl (100/N/A/100)
- catalog-email-impl (100/75/100)

## Key Findings

1. **Zero-Coverage Crisis:** 3 modules have 0% instruction/complexity coverage, including the critical `banner-marking` security module.

2. **Security Module Gap:** The `banner-marking` module handles classified data security markings but has NO test coverage. This is a critical security risk and must be addressed immediately.

3. **Military Data Format Libraries:** Two critical military data format libraries (`stanag4609`, `klv`) have inadequate coverage for parsing security-sensitive metadata.

4. **Strong Foundation:** 15 of 21 modules (71%) meet or exceed the 75% baseline, indicating a solid foundation for improvement.

5. **Branch Coverage Gap:** Several modules have 100% instruction/complexity but only 50% branch coverage, indicating missing conditional logic tests.

6. **Data Quality Note:** Some modules show missing branch % data (displayed as blank in the heat map). This may indicate data collection issues or modules with no branching logic.

## DO-278 Compliance Assessment

### Current State vs. DO-278 Requirements

**DO-278 Requirement:** Software must achieve:
- **Modified Condition/Decision Coverage (MC/DC)** for Level A software
- **Decision Coverage** for Level B software
- **Statement Coverage** for Level C software

**Alliance Current State:**
- Overall: ~71% of modules meet 75% baseline
- Critical Gap: Security modules below baseline
- Strength: Core functionality well-tested

**Gap Analysis:**
- **Critical:** 3 modules with 0% coverage (banner-marking, stanag4609, imaging-service-impl)
- **High:** 3 modules with <75% coverage (klv, imaging-transformer-chipping, video-admin-plugin)
- **Target:** All modules ≥ 80% overall, security modules ≥ 90%

### Recommended DO-278 Approach

1. **Establish Baseline:** This audit serves as the baseline
2. **Prioritize Security:** Address P0/P1 security modules first
3. **Test-First Development:** Write tests before fixes (per CLAUDE.md)
4. **Traceability:** Link tests to requirements (Phase 3)
5. **Continuous Monitoring:** Re-run analysis after each sprint

## Next Steps

1. **Review this report** with the development team
2. **Assign owners** to P0 and P1 modules
3. **Create test plans** for each critical module
4. **Follow Security Issue Remediation Process** from CLAUDE.md for banner-marking
5. **Track progress** using GitHub Issues or project management tool
6. **Re-run audit** after Week 5 to measure progress
